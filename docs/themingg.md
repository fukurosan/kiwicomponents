# Theming

The components of this project can be themed by using CSS variables. For more information about typography (fonts, text, etc) check the Typography section. For more information about scrollbars check the Scrollbar section.

## Project Colors

Some components like toasts and buttons can be configured with a type that changes their color. All these colors are configurable using CSS variables.

Each color has a "with" version which is the color that should preferably be rendered in the foreground of it (i.e. on top of it). This is usually used for determining the text color to be used on top of it.

The following CSS variables can be set:

| Variable Name                     |
| --------------------------------- |
| --kiwi-primary-color-dark         |
| --kiwi-primary-color              |
| --kiwi-primary-color-light        |
