# Theming

The components of this project can be themed by using CSS variables. For more information about typography (fonts, text, etc) check the Typography section. For more information about scrollbars check the Scrollbar section.

## Project Colors

Some components like toasts and buttons can be configured with a type, that changes their color. All these colors are configurable by using CSS variables.

Each color has a "with" version is the color that should preferably be rendered on top of the provided color (e.g. what text color fits on that specific background).

The following CSS variables can be set:

| Variable Name                     |
