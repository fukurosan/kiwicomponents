## What is this?

Kiwi Components is an SDK for web browsers.

The library aims to simplify typically difficult or boilerplate-heavy parts of web application development, and enables you to easily add functionality like window management, notifications, context menus and a whole bunch more through a declarative API.

The entire library is framework agnostic, and purely built on standard HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This means that regardless of what other technologies you are working with Kiwi Components will be compatible with them.
